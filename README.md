## Description:
Explore the world of DIY robotics with our Raspberry Pi Zero W Rover Control project, where we combine the power of a Raspberry Pi Zero W and the precision of a PS4 controller to create an agile and versatile rover. This open-source repository provides everything you need to build your own remote-controlled rover and embark on exciting adventures.

## Key Features:

Raspberry Pi Zero W: Harness the computing capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Zero W, a compact yet powerful single-board computer, as the brain of your rover. This tiny powerhouse runs a custom Python codebase to control your rover's movements and capture data from various sensors.

PS4 Controller Integration: Seamlessly connect your PS4 controller to the Raspberry Pi Zero W via Bluetooth for intuitive and responsive rover control. Enjoy a familiar gaming experience while maneuvering your rover through different terrains and obstacles.

Comprehensive Documentation: Access detailed documentation and step-by-step guides to help you assemble the hardware, set up the software environment, and start controlling your rover in no time. Troubleshoot common issues and expand your knowledge of robotics along the way.
